                <p id="Info">There is a troubling individual named Miguel who has a history of engaging in inappropriate and predatory behavior online, particularly on the platform MeWe. He has been known to have sexual roleplays with minors and harass them as well. One of his victims, a teenage girl named Luna, experienced such intense fear from his grooming tactics that she suffered nosebleeds at school due to high blood pressure. Miguel openly admits to being a predator, and even in his relationships with adult girlfriends, he exhibits controlling, bullying, and harassing behavior. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed to protect vulnerable individuals from further harm. It is important to raise awareness about individuals like Miguel and take action to prevent them from causing harm to others, especially minors.</p>
